## Course Introduction
The Django E-commerce Tutorial Series is designed for students who wants to learn the Django Framework by building an e-commerce application. This course is a great way to start learning Python and the Django Framework. We start from a beginners level slowly moving into more advanced topics. I have tried to design this course to be modular so that you could also focus in on particular subjects, tutorials or aspects of Django should you prefer this mode of learning.

On this course you will be taught a wide range of skills, here are a few topics that we will be learning:

* Django URLs, models, views
* Django Templating
* Introduction to Unittest
* Testing with Pytest
* Working with Django and Docker
* Deploying Django Applications
